# Cloud Basic Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Cloud Basic Course, taught at University of Trieste in 2023/2024.

# Cloud Based File Storage System

The task is to identify, deploy and implement a cloud-based file storage system. The system should allow users to upload, download, and delete files. Each user should have a private storage space. The system should be scalable, secure, and cost-efficient. 
The requirements for the deployed platform are: 

**Manage User Authentication and Authorization:**
- Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.
- Users should have different roles (e.g., regular user and admin).
- Regular users should have their private storage space.
- Admins should have the ability to manage users.

**Manage File Operations:**
- Users should be able to upload files to their private storage.
- Users should be able to download files from their private storage.
- Users should be able to delete files from their private storage.

**Address Scalability:**
- Design the system to handle a growing number of users and files.
- Discuss theoretically how to handle increased load and traffic.

**Address Security:**
- Implement secure file storage and transmission.
- Discuss how to secure user authentication.
- Discuss measures to prevent unauthorized access.

**Discuss Cost-Efficiency:**
- Consider the cost implications of the chosen design.
- Discuss how to optimize the system for cost efficiency.

**Deployment:**
- Provide a deployment plan for the system in a containerized environment on your laptop based on docker and docker-compose.
- Discuss how to monitor and manage the deployed system.
- Choose a cloud provider that could be used to deploy the system in production and justify your choice.

**Test the infrastructure:**
- Consider the performance of the system in terms of load and IO operations
